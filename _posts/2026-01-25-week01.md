Open Source to me means that the line between users and developers are not so rigid. Users can always inspect the source code, and if there is a part they don't like or a feature they think is missing, they can become a developer to contribute to the project. This has both pros and cons simultaneously. I remember learning about how a hacker contributed to the Linux xz Library for three years genuinely to gain the trust of the other contributors before installing a backdoor. This is an almost unavoidable consequence to letting anyone contribute. On the other hand, the backdoor was found and fixed because a developer using the library noticed a performance decay and inspected the source code. I think this total transparency is what makes open source unique and so important for the software community.
