## Code of Conduct Activity

The community element in open source development is arguably more important than the code element. As the community for a project grows bigger and bigger, it inevitably will require  strangers who might never have interactions in real life work closely together. They might live totally different lives and have the complete opposite values. Thus there needs to be a set of guidelines or rules to ensure the project functions efficiently as an organization. I believe that the code of conduct is important because it determines how contributors to the project interact, collaborate, and resolve disputes with each other. The [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct) serves as a good example, it explicitly defines what the contributors should and shoudn't do. 

The Go Community Code of Conduct is adapted directly from the [Contributor Covenant, version 1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/), as it added a section on Gopher Values and the goals of the code of conduct on top of the original covenant. This adds a layer of focus on the positive behaviours that benefits collaboration, while the original covenant focuses on negative behaviours to avoid. The [Eclipse Community Code of Conduct](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) is also adapted from the Contributor Covenant. Eclipse expanded the section on enforcement actions and added the no retaliation rule, which protects contributors that raises issues from being punished or harassed.
